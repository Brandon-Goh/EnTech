# EnTech

Co-founded the EnTech-IRHS club in order to implement technology into the rigid framework of the Ontario secondary education. A few students, teachers and I noticed that STEAM courses lack certain technology that would improve curriculum and give students the fully immersive learning experience.

## What I did:

 - Co-founded, formulated and constructed a makerspace/TechHub at my high school used by 100+ students

 - Collaborated with industry partners such as Tiercel, InkSmith and Fireside Analytics to implement tech such as 3D printers, VR systems and multitouch tables that would improve cross-curricular learning and applications
